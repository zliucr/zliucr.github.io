I am [Zihan (Johan) Liu](https://zliucr.github.io) (刘子涵). I received Bachelor Degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk) supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/index.html) in [Center of AI Research](https://caire.ust.hk/).

My current research interests are cross-lingual adaptation, cross-domain adaptation, few-shot learning, and dialogue systems.

I serve as the Program Committee and Reviewer:

- ACL (2020, 2021), EMNLP (2020, 2021), AAAI 2021, NAACL 2021, Neuips 2021

## Highlights
- "Continual Mixed-Language Pre-Training for Extremely Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation" accepted at Findings of ACL 2021
- Two papers accepted at NAACL 2021: "Towards Low-Resource Domain Adaptation for Abstractive Summarization" and "Multimodal End-to-End Sparse Model for Emotion Recognition". More details can be found [here](https://zliucr.github.io/publications/).
- Two papers accepted at AAAI 2021! More details can be found [here](https://zliucr.github.io/publications/).
