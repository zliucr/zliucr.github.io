I am [Zihan Liu](https://zliucr.github.io) (刘子涵). I am a Senior research scientist at [Nvidia Applied Deep Learning Research (ADLR) Team](https://nv-adlr.github.io/). I received Bachelor Degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), and Ph.D. Degree from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Pascale Fung](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/index.html) in [Center of AI Research](https://caire.ust.hk/). I work on LLMs reasoning, post-training, and RAG.
