I am a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/). Few years ago, I finished my Bachelor in Computer Science at Institut Teknologi Bandung. 

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of the Natural Language Understanding, Multilingual, Cross-lingual, Code-Switching, Dialogue, and Speech.
