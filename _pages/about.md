I am [Zihan (Johan) Liu](https://zliucr.github.io) (刘子涵). I received Bachelor Degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology supervised by [Prof. Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/) in [Center of AI Research](https://caire.ust.hk/).

My current research interests are cross-lingual adaptation, cross-domain adaptation, few-shot learning, and dialogue systems.

## Highlights
- [Cross-Accented ASR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.01901.pdf) accepted at Interspeech 2020.
- Two papers accepted at ACL 2020. 1) Coach: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach for Cross-domain Slot Filling; 2) Meta-Transfer Learning for Code-Switched Speech Recognition.
- [Low-rank Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13923) accepted at ICASSP 2020 (oral)
- First author paper [Mixed-Language Training for Cross-lingual Task-oriented Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09273) accepted at AAAI 2020 (oral)
- [CAiRE Chatbot](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12108) accepted as a demo paper at AAAI 2020 ([Demo](http://eez115.ece.ust.hk:8899/chatbot_home.html)).
- First author paper [Zero-shot Cross-lingual NLU](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1129/) accepted at EMNLP 2019 (poster)
