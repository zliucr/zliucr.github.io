Despite the surging demands for multilingual task-oriented dialog systems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home), there has been less research done in multilingual or cross-lingual scenarios.  Hence, we propose a zero-shot adaptation of task-oriented dialogue systems to low resource languages. To tackle this challenge, we first use a set of very few parallel word pairs to refine the aligned cross-lingual word-level representations. We then employ a latent variable model to cope with the variance of similar sentences across different languages, which is induced by imperfect cross-lingual alignments and inherent differences in languages. Finally, the experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art intent accuracy and slot F1 score for both English-to-Spanish and English-to-Thai (a low resource language) in zero-shot scenarios.
